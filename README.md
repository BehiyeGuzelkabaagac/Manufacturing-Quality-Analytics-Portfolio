### 1. 🔍 Steel Defect Detection & Predictive Quality Control
**[View Full Project →](01_Steel_Defect_Detection/)**

A comprehensive machine learning system for automated steel surface defect detection, addressing a multi-million dollar problem in manufacturing quality control.

**Business Problem:**  
Steel manufacturing defects cost the industry millions annually through rework, scrap, and customer returns. Manual inspection is slow, expensive, and inconsistent.

**Solution:**  
Built a multi-label classification system to automatically detect and classify 7 types of surface defects using production line sensor data.

**Key Results:**
- ⚡ **80% overall accuracy** across all defect types
- 🎯 **98% F1-score** for K_Scratch defects (production-ready)
- 📊 **72% recall** for bump detection (catches most critical defects)
- 💰 Potential to reduce inspection time by 40%

**Technical Approach:**
- Handled severe class imbalance using SMOTE resampling
- Trained separate Random Forest classifiers for each defect type
- Feature importance analysis revealed geometric patterns as key predictors
- Implemented cost-sensitive evaluation (prioritizing recall over precision)

**Tech Stack:** Python • Scikit-learn • Random Forest • SMOTE • Pandas • Matplotlib

**Key Insight:**  
Model performance varies dramatically by defect type (F1: 0.58 to 0.98), revealing that defect complexity matters more than training sample size. Some defects are production-ready for automation, while others need targeted feature engineering.
